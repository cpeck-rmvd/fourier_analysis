# Topics in Fourier Analysis

Definitions:

***Absolute convergence***: the series converges based on norm (absolute value).  Weaker condition than strict convergence.

***Poisson Kernel***: an integral kernel, used for solving the two-dimensional Laplace equation, given Dirichlet boundary conditions on the unit disk.  
(Derived fron Green's Function)

***Cesaro sum***: the limit, as n tends to infinity, of the sequence of arithmetic means of the first n partial sums of the series.

***Fejer's Theorem***: Let the function F be bounded variation on (−∞,+∞). The function Fourier-Stieltjes transform is given by:

$$ \tag{* }
\phi ( x)  = \ 
{
\frac{1}{\sqrt {2 \pi } }
 }
\int\limits _ {- \infty } ^ { {+ }  \infty }
e  ^ {-} ixy  dF ( y)
$$

The function  

$$  
\phi 
$$

determined by the integral (*) is bounded and continuous. Every if this function is periodic, it can be expanded to

$$  
\sum _ {- \infty }  ^ {+ \infty } a _ {n} e  ^ {inx} 
$$

so we have:

$$
F ( x) = \sum _ {n \leq  x }  a _ {n} 
$$
